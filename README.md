## Resolving "HEAD Not Pointing to a Valid Commit" Error

This error occurs when the Git `HEAD` is not pointing to a valid commit. This often happens in newly initialized repositories where no commits have been made yet. Without an initial commit, Git cannot create or switch branches.

### Steps to Resolve:

1. **Make an Initial Commit**:
   - Stage all files for the commit:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Create the initial commit:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     ```

2. **Create a New Branch**:
   - Run the following command to create a new branch:
     ```bash
     git branch new-branch
     ```

3. **Switch to the New Branch**:
   - Check out the new branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout new-branch
     ```

### Explanation of Commands:
- `git add .` stages all changes in the current directory for the commit.
- `git commit -m "Initial commit"` saves the staged changes as a new commit with the message "Initial commit."
- `git branch new-branch` creates a new branch called `new-branch.`
- `git checkout new-branch` switches to the newly created branch.

After completing these steps, the error should no longer occur, and you can continue working on your Flutter project.
